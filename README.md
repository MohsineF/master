### Usage

Add at least one program section to taskmaster.conf, make sure to run the daemon first `./taskmasterd.py` before running your client `./taskmaster.py`

### Basic Commands:

`start`/`restart`/`stop` programs, 
`reload` rereads the configuration file (without stopping unchanged runnnig programs), 
`quit` kills the daemon (consequently all your programs as well) and the client, 
`exit` exits the client only.
(or just type `help`)
